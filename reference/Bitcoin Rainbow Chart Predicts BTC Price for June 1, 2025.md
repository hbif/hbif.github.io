# Bitcoin Rainbow Chart Predicts BTC Price for June 1, 2025  

## Bitcoin's Current Market Momentum  

Bitcoin (BTC) has entered a critical phase following its recent record high of $111,000. After briefly surpassing this milestone mid-week, BTC retreated to $107,498 at the time of writingâ€”a 1.2% drop in 24 hours but a nearly identical weekly gain. This volatility underscores the cryptocurrency's sensitivity to institutional capital flows, which drove the initial surge.  

Technical indicators suggest Bitcoin is approaching **overbought territory**, with the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 63. However, bullish momentum persists: the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) remain anchored at $94,730 and $86,569, respectively. These levels act as critical support zones amid short-term corrections.

## Understanding the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart  

The **Bitcoin Rainbow Chart**, a logarithmic growth model developed by BlockchainCenter, visualizes investor sentiment across nine price zonesâ€”from "Bitcoin is Dead" (deep bearish territory) to "Maximum Bubble Territory" (extreme overvaluation). This tool extrapolates historical trends to project potential price ranges for June 1, 2025.  

### Key Price Zones for June 1, 2025  

| Price Range (USD)       | Investor Sentiment Zone       | Strategic Implication                 |  
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|  
| <$43,000                 | Basically a Fire Sale         | Severe undervaluation; buying opportunity |  
| $43,000â€“$58,000          | BUY! Zone                     | Aggressive accumulation recommended     |  
| $58,000â€“$75,000          | Accumulate                    | Cautious optimism; long-term positioning |  
| $75,000â€“$97,800          | Still Cheap                   | Reasonable value for patient holders    |  
| $97,800â€“$128,600         | HODL!                         | Resist selling; current zone            |  
| $128,600â€“$164,400        | Is This a Bubble?             | Caution advised; potential overheating  |  
| $164,400â€“$211,400        | FOMO Zone                     | Heightened speculation; volatility risk |

| $276,300â€“$372,800        | Maximum Bubble Territory      | Market euphoria; unsustainable levels   |  

## BTC Price Prediction for June 1, 2025  

The chart projects Bitcoin trading between **$32,787 and $372,813** by June 1. While the $97,800â€“$128,600 "HODL!" zone aligns with current price action, the cryptocurrency's trajectory depends on macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and adoption rates.  

### Extreme Bullish Scenarios  

If BTC breaches $164,400, the market could experience intensified FOMO, pushing prices into the $211,400â€“$276,300 range. At this stage, experts advise caution, as the asset enters "Sell. Seriously, SELL!" territory. A surge beyond $276,300 would place Bitcoin in "Maximum Bubble Territory," signaling extreme overvaluation.  

### Limitations of the Rainbow Chart  

While the Rainbow Chart provides historical context, it's not a definitive predictor. Key limitations include:  
- **Extrapolation bias**: Relies on logarithmic trends, ignoring sudden market shocks.  
- **Macro risks**: Interest rates, geopolitical events, or regulatory changes can disrupt projections.  
- **Adoption curves**: Accelerated institutional adoption or technological breakthroughs may invalidate historical patterns.

## FAQs  

### 1. **How does the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart work?**  
The chart uses a logarithmic regression of Bitcoin's historical prices to create nine color-coded zones. These zones represent investor sentiment levels, from panic ("Bitcoin is Dead") to euphoria ("Maximum Bubble Territory").  

### 2. **Is the Rainbow Chart reliable for price predictions?**  
While the chart illustrates historical trends, it shouldn't be used in isolation. Combine it with technical indicators (RSI, MACD) and fundamental analysis (adoption rates, on-chain metrics) for balanced insights.  

### 3. **What factors could push Bitcoin into "Bubble Territory"?**  
Key drivers include institutional ETF approvals, hyperbitcoinization narratives, or a collapse in fiat currencies. Conversely, stricter regulations or security breaches could trigger sharp corrections.  

### 4. **Should I sell if Bitcoin reaches the "HODL!" zone?**  
The "HODL!" zone ($97,800â€“$128,600) suggests holding rather than selling. However, allocate profits gradually if the price approaches the "Bubble" thresholds.  

### 5. **How accurate has the Rainbow Chart been historically?**  
The chart successfully highlighted Bitcoin's 2017 and 2021 bull runs but underestimated the 2020â€“2021 cycle due to unprecedented liquidity injections. Always validate with real-time data.  

## Conclusion  

The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart offers a compelling visual narrative for June 1, 2025, but investors must remain vigilant. With BTC currently in the "HODL!" zone, the focus shifts to macroeconomic stability and regulatory clarity. For traders seeking real-time analytics, platforms like OKX provide advanced tools to navigate this volatile market.
