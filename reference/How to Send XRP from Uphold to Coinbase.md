## Why Accuracy Matters in Crypto Transactions  

Unlike traditional banking, cryptocurrency transfers are irreversible. A single typo in a wallet address or selecting the wrong network can lead to permanent loss. Always:

- Test with small amounts first.  
- Enable transaction confirmations in your wallet settings.
