## Frequently Asked Questions  

### Q1: What is Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio?  
The LTV ratio determines how much you can borrow against your collateral. For example, a 50% LTV allows borrowing $5,000 against $10,000 worth of BTC. Higher LTV ratios increase liquidation risks.  

### Q2: How are Crypto Loan Rates Determined?  
Interest rates depend on:  
- Asset supply/demand dynamics  
- Loan duration  
- Collateral type (stablecoins vs. volatile assets)  
- Platform-specific risk assessments  

### Q3: What Happens if I Default on a Loan?  
Most platforms automatically liquidate collateral when the LTV threshold is breached. For instance, if your BTC collateral drops below 110% of the loan value, the system may sell assets to cover the debt.  

### Q4: Can I Earn Interest on Stablecoins?  
Yes! Platforms like Binance and Gemini offer up to 12% APY on USDT and USDC deposits. This provides stable returns with lower volatility risk.  

### Q5: Are Crypto Loans Regulated?  
Regulation varies by jurisdiction. Platforms like Gemini and Coinbase operate under strict US financial regulations, while others follow Singapore or Malta frameworks.  

## Tax Implications of Crypto Lending  

Crypto lending typically isn't a taxable event in most jurisdictions since no asset is sold. However:  
- **Interest Income**: Taxable as ordinary income in many countries  
- **Collateral Liquidation**: May trigger capital gains tax  
- **Jurisdiction-Specific Rules**: Consult a tax professional for accurate guidance
