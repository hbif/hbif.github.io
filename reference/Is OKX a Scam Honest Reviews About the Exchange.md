# Is OKX a Scam? Honest Reviews About the Exchange

Cryptocurrency trading platforms have become essential for investors seeking to navigate the digital asset market. Among these, **OKX** has emerged as a prominent exchange, but questions about its legitimacy persist. This comprehensive review explores the platformâ€™s features, security measures, user experiences, and regulatory compliance to determine whether OKX is a scam or a trustworthy platform for cryptocurrency trading.

## Why OKX Stands Out in the Crypto Space

As a rebranded version of OKEx, **OKX crypto exchange** has evolved into one of the most functional platforms for trading digital assets. Launched in 2014 as a subsidiary of OKCoin, OKX separated from its parent company in 2017 to operate independently. Today, it offers:  

- **Over 300 cryptocurrencies**, including rare tokens like Yoyow and Waltonchain  
- **Advanced trading tools** such as margin trading with up to 20x leverage  
- **Low transaction fees** (ranging from -0.01% to 0.05% for futures trading)  
- **Multi-language support** (English, Chinese, and Cantonese)  

The platform caters to both novice and professional traders, though U.S. residents and users from certain restricted countries face limitations.

### User Onboarding Process  
Creating an account requires minimal effort:  
1. Provide a phone number or email address  
2. Complete identity verification (passport upload required for full access)

2. Select your preferred cryptocurrency and copy the wallet address  
3. Transfer funds from your external wallet  

Withdrawals require verification and an administrator password. While most transactions complete within minutes, delays occasionally occur due to network congestion or security checks.  

### Fee Structure  
| Transaction Type | Fee Range |  
|-------------------|-----------|  
| Spot Trading      | 0.01%-0.1% |  
| Futures Trading   | -0.01%-0.05% |  
| Margin Trading    | 0.01%-0.05% |
