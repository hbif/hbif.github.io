## Why Use Tether for Overseas FX Transactions?  

### Stability Meets Convenience  
As the first stablecoin (launched in 2014), USDT combines fiat currency stability (pegged to USD) with blockchain efficiency. This makes it ideal for traders seeking:  
- **Low volatility** compared to BTC/ETH  
- **Fast cross-border transactions**  
- **Cost-effective fund management**  

### Key Advantages  
1. **Rapid Settlement**: Blockchain-based transfers complete in minutes vs. days for traditional bank wires.  
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Eliminates intermediary fees common in fiat transactions.  
3. **Market Resilience**: Maintains value during crypto market turbulence.  

**Example**: A trader making 50 annual deposits saves $2,500+ annually at $50 average bank wire fees.

## Potential Risks and Limitations  

### Price Volatility Risks  
While USDT maintains a 1:1 USD peg, **rare fluctuations of Â±10% have occurred** during extreme market conditions (e.g., TerraUSD collapse in 2022).  

### Counterparty Risks  
USDT's value depends on Tether Ltd.'s reserve holdings. Regulatory scrutiny or liquidity crises could destabilize its peg.  

### Limited Domestic Availability  
Japanese investors face challenges accessing USDT directly, often requiring third-party wallets like **STICPAY** or **BXONE** for FX integration.

## Critical Considerations for USDT Transactions  

### Network Compatibility  
Always match blockchain protocols:  
- **ERC20** (Ethereum) vs. **TRC20** (Tron)  
- Sending TRC20 tokens to an ERC20 address risks permanent loss  

**Network Comparison**:  
| Feature         | TRC20 (Tron)       | ERC20 (Ethereum)    |  
|-----------------|--------------------|---------------------|  
| Avg. Transaction Time | 2â€“5 seconds       | 1â€“15 minutes        |  
| Avg. Fee        | <$0.01             | $0.50â€“$15+          |  
| Ecosystem Support | Growing           | Established         |  

### Withdrawal Policy Verification  
Exness requires USDT withdrawals match deposit methods, while platforms like FXGT allow fiat conversions. Always confirm policies before depositing.
