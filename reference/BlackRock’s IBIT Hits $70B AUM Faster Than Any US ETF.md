# BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT Hits $70B AUM Faster Than Any US ETF  

## Surging Inflows Cement IBIT as the Dominant Bitcoin ETF  

BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has achieved a historic milestone, reaching $70 billion in assets under management (AUM) faster than any other exchange-traded fund in US history. This rapid growth, fueled by institutional and retail investor demand, positions IBIT as a transformative force in the ETF landscape.  

### Unprecedented Growth in Just 341 Trading Days  

IBIT‚Äôs ascent to $70B AUM in 341 trading days dwarfs the growth rates of traditional ETFs like the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) and the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG). According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, IBIT now ranks as the fourth-largest ETF in the US by year-to-date inflows. As of June 23, 2025, IBIT attracted $13.7 billion in inflows, surpassing SPLG‚Äôs $13.4 billion and trailing only VTI‚Äôs $19.3 billion.  

**Key Factors Driving IBIT‚Äôs Growth:**  
- **Institutional Adoption**: BlackRock‚Äôs reputation as a trusted asset manager has accelerated institutional trust in Bitcoin.  
- **Fee Revenue Leadership**: IBIT generates $186 million annually in fees, overtaking BlackRock‚Äôs flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), which earns $183 million despite holding $10X more AUM.  
- **Investor Preference**: Analyst James Check highlights that IBIT captures the majority of weekly inflows while competitors experience stagnation or outflows.
