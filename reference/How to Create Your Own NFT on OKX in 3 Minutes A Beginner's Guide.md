# How to Create Your Own NFT on OKX in 3 Minutes: A Beginner's Guide

The OKX NFT marketplace empowers users to discover, trade, and create NFTs across popular blockchains like Ethereum and Polygon. With OKX, minting your own NFT has never been easier â€“ and it's completely free. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the entire process while exploring the innovative world of AI-generated NFTs.

## Quick Overview

## Getting Started with OKX NFT

Before creating your digital masterpiece, you'll need to prepare your OKX Wallet (available as a mobile app for iOS/Android or browser extension).
