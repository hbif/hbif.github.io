# Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Remains Stable as Pectra Upgrade Launches on Mainnet  

Ethereum (ETH) maintained stability at **$1,790** on Wednesday despite the activation of the highly anticipated **Pectra Upgrade** on its mainnet. This upgrade, incorporating 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), introduces critical enhancements to user experience, staking efficiency, and Layer-2 (L2) scaling capabilities. However, technical indicators suggest potential bearish momentum as ETH approaches the apex of a symmetrical triangle pattern on its price chart.

## Pectra Upgrade Successfully Activates on Mainnet  

Following multiple delays and testnet challenges, Ethereumâ€™s **Pectra Upgrade** went live at approximately **10:05 GMT** on Wednesday, marking a significant milestone in Ethereumâ€™s evolution. The upgrade integrates code changes from 11 EIPs, positioning it as the most ambitious update since the **Merge** in August 2022, which transitioned Ethereum from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.  

> "Pectra represents Ethereumâ€™s metamorphosisâ€”smoother, smarter, and more accessible," said **Binji Pande**, Growth Lead at Optimismâ€™s Superchain.  

### Key Features of the Pectra Upgrade  
1. **Smart Account Wallet UX Improvements**: Streamlined user interactions with wallets.  
2. **2x L2 Data Storage Capacity**: Enhanced blob data availability for rollups.  
3. **Validator Experience Enhancements**: Simplified staking operations for validators.  

The upgrade follows the **Dencun Upgrade** in March 2024, which activated **EIP-4844** (proto-danksharding) to reduce L2 transaction costs. Developers now turn their focus to the upcoming **Fusaka Upgrade**, expected by the end of 2025.

## Core Technical Enhancements in Pectra  

### **EIP-7702: Paving the Way for Account Abstraction**  
Co-authored by Ethereum co-founder **Vitalik Buterin**, EIP-7702 introduces foundational changes for **account abstraction**. This allows external owned accounts (EOAs) to temporarily exhibit smart contract-like functionality, enabling:  
- **Batched Transactions**: Users can merge multiple operations into a single transaction, reducing gas fees.  
- **Third-Party Gas Payment**: Wallets or dApps can cover gas fees, enabling gasless transactions for new users.  
- **ERC-20 Gas Payments**: Users can pay gas fees with popular ERC-20 tokens instead of ETH.  

> "This will revolutionize L2 and L3 environments, allowing developers to create seamless user experiences," said **Preston Van Loon**, co-founder of Prysmatic Labs.  

### **EIP-7251: Boosting Staking Efficiency**  
EIP-7251 increases the **maximum validator balance** from **32 ETH** to **2,048 ETH**. This reduces hardware requirements for large stakers by consolidating funds into fewer validator nodes. Critics warn of potential centralization risks, but proponents argue it optimizes capital efficiency.  

### **EIP-7691: Expanding Blob Data Capacity**  
By doubling the target and maximum blobs per block from **3/6 to 6/9**, EIP-7691 enhances **data availability (DA)** for L2 solutions. While this lowers transaction costs for rollups, some analysts caution it may impact Ethereumâ€™s revenue from blob fees, which have declined since the Dencun Upgrade.

## Ethereum Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Reveals Bearish Signals  

Despite the Pectra Upgradeâ€™s activation, ETHâ€™s technical indicators suggest caution.  

### **Key Observations**  
- **Symmetrical Triangle Pattern**: ETH is nearing the apex of this pattern, with a potential breakout imminent.  
- **Moving Averages**: The 14-day EMA ($1,775) and 50-day SMA ($1,740) provided short-term support after a dip to $1,750.  
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: The RSI has fallen below its 50-level threshold, signaling bearish momentum.  
- **Stochastic Oscillator**: Testing neutral levels, indicating weakening bullish pressure.  

### **Critical Price Levels**  
| Indicator         | Level       | Implication                     |  
|--------------------|-------------|---------------------------------|  
| Immediate Support  | $1,740      | 50-day SMA                      |  
| Key Resistance     | $1,820      | Upper boundary of triangle      |  
| Bearish Trigger    | <$1,700     | Accelerated downtrend possible  |  

A daily close below **$1,740** could validate a bearish trend, potentially dragging ETH to **$1,600** in the medium term.
