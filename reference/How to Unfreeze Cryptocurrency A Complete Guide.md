## What Is a Crypto Freeze?  

A cryptocurrency freeze restricts access to digital assets, preventing withdrawals, transfers, or sales. Common causes include:  

- **Regulatory Compliance**: KYC/AML investigations.  
- **Security Concerns**: Suspicious account activity.  
- **Technical Issues**: Blockchain network maintenance.  

Freezes may be temporary (e.g., during account verification) or permanent (e.g., in cases of fraud). Understanding the root cause is critical for resolution.  

### How Crypto Freezes Work  

Immutability on blockchain ensures transaction records cannot be altered, but exchanges can freeze assets by restricting account access. Decentralized platforms may use smart contracts to automate freezes under predefined conditions.
