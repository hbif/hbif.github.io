## Global Comparisons: Ownership Rates vs. Total Numbers  

While India leads in total crypto owners, smaller nations like Ukraine (12.73% ownership rate) and Russia (11.91%) outpace it in population penetration. The U.S. (8.31%) and Kenya (8.52%) also rank higher proportionally. This contrast highlights Indiaâ€™s unique combination of scale and growth potential.  

| Country       | Total Crypto Owners (Crore) | Ownership Rate (%) |  
|---------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|  
| India         | 10.07                       | 7.30               |  
| United States | 2.74                        | 8.31               |

## Regulatory Uncertainty and Market Resilience  

Indiaâ€™s crypto journey has been marked by regulatory ambiguity. In 2021, the government proposed a bill to ban private cryptocurrencies, sparking fears of a crackdown. However, the bill was deferred, and a committee was formed to evaluate its implications. Since then, the government has adopted a more cautious stance, prioritizing taxation and oversight over prohibition.  

### Why Legal Clarity Matters  
- **Investor Confidence**: Clear regulations could attract institutional investors.  
- **Taxation Framework**: Indiaâ€™s 30% tax on crypto gains (plus 4% cess) underscores its recognition of the sector.  
- **Global Alignment**: Regulatory harmonization with G20 nations may stabilize the market long-term.
