# SEC Approves Grayscale‚Äôs Multi-Cryptocurrency Index ETF: XRP, SOL, ADA to Rise  

## A Historic Moment for Cryptocurrency Markets  

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially approved Grayscale‚Äôs Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) as the first multi-cryptocurrency spot ETF. This landmark decision, finalized on July 1, 2025, marks a pivotal shift in institutional adoption of digital assets. The ETF will trade on NYSE Arca and include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), with a current asset under management (AUM) value of $754 million.  

The approval aligns with growing demand for diversified crypto exposure, mirroring traditional equity indices like the S&P 500. Analysts predict this move could catalyze further ETF approvals, particularly for standalone assets like XRP, SOL, and ADA.

## Bitwise ETF: The Next Potential Approval  

Following Grayscale‚Äôs success, attention turns to Bitwise‚Äôs 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW), which faces a July 31, 2025 deadline for SEC review. James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, emphasized the inevitability of approval:  

> ‚ÄúWe anticipated this decision. Over 90% of BITW‚Äôs holdings consist of Bitcoin and Ethereum, making regulatory hurdles less daunting. The SEC might even expedite the process.‚Äù  

This sentiment aligns with Bloomberg‚Äôs earlier projection of a 90%+ approval probability for crypto ETFs in 2025.

## Market Reactions and Whale Movements  

### XRP: Whale Transactions Signal Volatility  

Large XRP holders have exhibited mixed strategies. Wallets holding 1‚Äì100 million XRP stabilized after significant June purchases, while ‚Äúmegawhales‚Äù (100M‚Äì1B XRP) offloaded over 400 million tokens in 24 hours, contributing to a 6% weekly price drop. Analysts suggest this could precede a bullish reversal as institutional demand grows.  

### ADA: Whale Accumulation Fuels Optimism  

Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem saw sustained whale accumulation, with three top wallets steadily purchasing ADA since mid-June. This behavior reflects confidence in ADA‚Äôs potential ETF inclusion, mirroring the trajectory of Bitcoin and Ethereum.  

### SOL: Regulatory Clarity Drives Momentum  

Solana‚Äôs ETF staking approval in Q2 2025 strengthened its case for standalone ETF status. The SEC‚Äôs recent actions indicate a broader embrace of proof-of-stake assets, benefiting SOL‚Äôs regulatory positioning.
