# OKX Announces 80 Million Hamster Kombat (HMSTR) Token Airdrop

The OKX cryptocurrency exchange has launched a special campaign to distribute 80 million HMSTR tokens to both new users and experienced traders. This initiative coincides with the official listing of Hamster Kombat's native token, creating significant opportunities for crypto enthusiasts worldwide.

## OKX Campaign to Promote HMSTR

As one of the first major platforms to list Hamster Kombat (HMSTR), OKX will begin spot trading for this Telegram-based clicker game token on September 26. This strategic move positions OKX at the forefront of supporting emerging Web3 gaming ecosystems. Notably, other major exchanges like Bybit, Gate.io, and KuCoin have also announced HMSTR listings.

## How to Participate in the HMSTR Airdrop

The distribution program offers different pathways for both new and existing OKX users:

### For New Users
1. Create an OKX account and click "Join" on the campaign page
2. Deposit minimum 100 USDT
3. Trade HMSTR pairs totaling at least 100 USDT after September 26

### For Existing Users
1. Click "Join" on the campaign page
2. Trade HMSTR pairs totaling minimum 300 USDT after September 26

The campaign's primary objective is to boost market liquidity and community engagement for this rapidly growing gaming token.

## HMSTR Tokenomics and Market Potential

The Hamster Kombat project has allocated 60% of its total token supply for community distribution. While the exact circulating supply remains undisclosed, the game's existing user base already demonstrates remarkable traction:
- **80 million monthly active players**
- **55 million Telegram subscribers** (making it the largest channel on the platform)

This massive user adoption creates a strong foundation for sustained token utility and value creation.

### Why HMSTR Stands Out
1. **Massive Gaming Audience**: Built-in user base from the popular Telegram game
2. **Strategic Exchange Listings**: Simultaneous availability on multiple top-tier platforms
3. **Community-Driven Distribution**: Fair airdrop mechanism prioritizing early adopters

The combination of exchange support, fair distribution, and proven user engagement creates a compelling case for long-term token value.

As the crypto market continues its recovery trajectory in 2025, HMSTR's successful launch could pave the way for similar gaming projects seeking blockchain integration. The token's performance will be closely watched as a bellwether for Web3 gaming adoption rates.
